# Installing Powerline Status on Mac

I basically followed [this guide](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/jazz-up-your-bash-terminal-a-step-by-step-guide-with-pictures-80267554cb22). For the terminal app, I used [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/terminal/). Just in case, I uploaded its terminal file in this repo [too](Dracula.terminal).

In addition, just add these lines to the beginning of your `~/.bash_profile` file:
   ```
   export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
   ```
